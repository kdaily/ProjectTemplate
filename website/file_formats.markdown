ProjectTemplate can automatically load a variety of text based file formats, including comma separated value (CSV) files, tab separated value (TSV) files and generic whitespace separated value (WSV) files. In addition, automatic data loading is supported for several binary file formats, including the RData, SPSS, Stata and SAS formats.

Beyond those file formats, several ad hoc file types support the loading of data sets that are accessible over HTTP or contained in SQL databases, such as MySQL and sqlite.

Please note that several of file formats have not been tested yet, including Weka files, DBF files, EPIInfo files, MTP files, Octave files, Systat files and SAS files. Because ProjectTemplate is simply wrapping the 'foreign' package, these file formats are expected to work, but we have not confirmed that yet. Your mileage may vary.

#### Ad Hoc File Types

##### URL Files
You can access CSV files over HTTP using the `.url` file extension. Inside
of the `.url` file, you must place DCF that describes your data sources.
An example file is shown below:

		url: http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/ProjectTemplate/sample_data.csv

##### SQL Files
You can access databases stored in a MySQL database using the `.sql` file
extension. Inside of the `.sql` file, you must place DCF that describes
the connection protocol for your database. An example file is shown below:

		type: mysql
		user: sample_user
		password: sample_password
		host: localhost
		dbname: sample_database
		table: sample_table

You can also access databases stored in a SQLite file using the `.sql` file
extension. Inside of the `.sql` file, you must place DCF that describes
the details about the SQLite file. Two example files are shown below:

		type: sqlite
		dbname: /path/to/sample_database
		table: sample_table

		type: sqlite
		dbname: /path/to/sample_database
		query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_active == 1

##### .file Files
You can load data that is not stored in the current project using a `.file` file. You must specify the path and the extension that the file would have, if it were being loaded by the standard ProjectTemplate auto-loader. An example is shown below that would load an SQLite3 database stored in a separate location:

		path: /path/to/sample_database
		extension: db

#### Future Support Data Sources
In the future, ProjectTemplate could potentially support the following formats:

* ODBC
* JDBC
* Postgres
* SQL Server
* MondoDB
* CouchDB

If you'd like to help us implement support for these data sources or your favorite data source, please use the [mailing list](./mailing_list.html) to get in touch with us.
